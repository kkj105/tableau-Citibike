Including data from May 2019, September 2019, February 2020, May 2020, September 2020

# Who is the Citibike user?

Data has revealed the target Citibike user is a subscriber who is male, between the ages of 30-40 years of age. Of the 11.3 billion users within this dataset, Subscribers account for 62% and 39% are Short-term Customers. 

# When looking at those users who choose to not declare their gender, those riders are overwhelmingly Customers rather than Subscribers.

Analysis revealed a weakness in the method by which user birthdate is recorded – there is a spike of unknown Customers born in 1969. Whether this is due to 1969 being the default year for birthdate selection, it is clearly an anomaly in the dataset. 


# When are Citibikes used?

The specific dates of this dataset were selected in order to examine the effect of COVID-19, and especially the strict lockdown period of late February to March 2020 on Citibike usage. 

Over the period reflected in this dataset (roughly 12 months), peak usage occurs during typical commuting times. When it comes to usage/day, female and unknown riders hold steady throughout the week in when they ride. Male users are far more likely to use Citibike during the Mon-Fri workweek. This demonstrates male commuters are a key target customer for Citibike. 

What impact did COVID-19 have on Citibike usage? There was a sharp decline in usage from September 2019 to February 2020. However usage in September 2020 had grown to slightly surpass the number of Citibike trips as September 2019. In analyzing the type of usage, the amount of Customers using Citibike has grown in 2020 since February. The usage in Citibike is clearly holding strong, however this calls for a deeper examination into this recent growth in Customers vs Subscribers. 


# What is the average trip length?
 
Calculating what the average trip length is posed difficult given that data only provided starting and ending latitude/longitude of Citibike stations. What was discovered is that most users start and end their trip at the same station. Otherwise, the typical trip a Citibike user makes is no longer than roughly 11 miles. Unsurprisingly, during most users travelling during peak commuting hours go between 0 and 6 miles. This again supports who Citibikes target customer is. 


# What are the most popular Citibike stations?

Examining the difference between Citibike stations over the period represented in this dataset, what is most interesting to see is the marked expansion of usage in September 2019 and September 2020. In 2019, usage was heavily concentrated in Manhattan. In 2020, usage had expanded into the Bronx. Whether this corresponds to an expansion of Citibike stations between these dates is unknown, but worth exploring other reasons. The top 2 stations in recent months is 12 Ave & W 40 St and West St & Chambers St. Interestingly, during February, neither of those stations was popular – instead, the top station was located at Pershing Square North indicating most riders were using Citibike to go to and from Grand Central Station.
